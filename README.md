NepalMaps
---------

A small repository mapping data from Nepal. Maps are mainly made using R. The object of making this work, which is mostly experimentation, into a public repository is such that others may clone the repo and make their own maps using their own data.

A folder called "baselayers" includes some map data about Nepal. `NPL_adm` contains data about Nepal's administrative boundaries, downloaded from [GADM.org](http://gadm.org). The data is licensed CC-A-3.0 from `FortiusOne Inc. (via WorldBank; http://maps.worldbank.org/overlays/3238) (Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.)`. `districts.csv` is generated by the author, as a derivative work of the GADM / FortiusOne / WorldBank data.

Each mapping project usually sits in its own folder, and should be completely reproducible. Read the README file in each folder.
